# Medium Programming Topic Page Challenge

A React application built during week 5-6 of my software development course at \_nology. 

This application is a 1:1 reconstruction of the [Medium Programming topic page](https://medium.com/topic/programming). 

There is no functionality, but this challenge was a valuable exercise in achieving a specified design using SCSS, and how to lay out a hierarchy for components in React. 

Placeholder pictures were taken from [Fill Murray](http://www.fillmurray.com/). 

### Languages/Frameworks Used

* React
* HTML 5
* CSS 3/SCSS
* Javascript ES6
